# Deduplication in Singly-Linked-List
## Asked by: Oracle

Remove all instances of element from singly linked list so the resulting linked list will only contain elements whose
occurrence was exactly once.

e.g.
Example 01
```
Input: 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4
Output: 2 -> 4
```

Example 02
```
Input: 1 -> 1 -> 1
Output: null
```

Example 03
```
Input: 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3
Output: 2
```
